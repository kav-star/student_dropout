# 📊 Student Dropout Analysis for School Education – Smart Education

A data-driven software solution developed to analyse student dropout patterns across government schools in Karnataka. This project supports the Right to Education initiative by enabling focused policy interventions based on insights from dropout data.

## 🏫 Project Overview

High dropout rates in school education are a major concern, especially due to poverty, social, and economic factors. This system helps the Government of Karnataka identify and address dropout trends across various categories:

- School-wise
- Area-wise (Urban/Rural)
- Gender-wise
- Caste-wise
- Age/Standard-wise

## 🎯 Objectives

Our project aims to:

- Collect and pre-process dropout data from authentic sources.
- Analyse dropout patterns using machine learning models.
- Provide real-time analysis through a web-based dashboard.
- Enable manual data entry via web forms for live monitoring.
- Support policymakers and school authorities in identifying high-risk categories.
- Facilitate focused interventions to reduce dropout rates.
